# Learning-JavaScript
Getting the feel of JS to see if its a suitable career path for me

### 6.12.24 
Today i went over introduction to JavaScript and researched the language.  
I followed the JavaScript roadmap on roadman.sh and covered the following:  
  What is JavaScript  
  History of JavaScript  
  JavaScript versions  
  How to run JavaScript

### 8.12.24  
Went over JS and html syntax. Tried writing code in google js console. Set up the environment in vscode to work with js, html and css.  

### 9.12.24  
JavaScript runs in the order it appears in your HTML file. To avoid issues:

1. Place <script> tags at the end of the <body> (simple approach).
2. Use defer or DOMContentLoaded for more control in larger projects.

This ensures your JavaScript code interacts with elements that are already loaded into the DOM.
